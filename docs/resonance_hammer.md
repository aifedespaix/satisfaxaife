# Resonance Hammer

The **Resonance Hammer** unleashes a circular shockwave on impact. The wave expands
from the wielder, rebounds at its maximum reach and returns with increased
strength, striking anything it meets along the way. Each reflection multiplies
the damage, rewarding precise timing and positioning.

> **Note**
> Sprite and audio assets will be integrated separately. The current
> implementation uses placeholder visuals.

# Gravity Well Cannon

The **Gravity Well Cannon** launches a sphere that collapses into a short-lived
mini black hole. Nearby entities and projectiles are pulled toward the center
and take continuous damage while trapped in the field.

The effect lasts a few seconds and provides strong area control, enabling
powerful combos with other weapons.

> **Note**
> Sprite and audio assets will be added in a future update. Current
> implementation uses placeholder visuals.
